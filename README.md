# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends within sucessful and failed campaigns

## General Analysis of Data
The analysis of the Kickstarter data found that the mean goal of successful campaigns was $5,048 while the median was $3,000. The mean goal for failed campaigns was $10,554 and the median was $5,000. The standard deviation for successful campaigns was $7,748 and for failed was $21,967. With such a large standard deviation, the data is spread out greatly and not clustered around the mean. The data also has a few outliers that effect the standard deviation and skew the data. To perform further analysis it would be wise to remove the outliers and redo the analysis to get a better conclusion. 

### Challenge
After the analysis, the best time to start a theater campaign is in the month of May. There are more successful campaigns in May than any other month, so the probability of a campaign being successful is much higher. The analysis also showed that the lower the amount for a goal, the higher chance it had to succeed. This trend is quite visible with amounts lower than $25,000, but more data is required to conclusively say the trend continues with amounts higher than $25,000. A graph showing the percentage of successful and failed campaigns in the parent category “Theater” would be useful in determining if the trend continued beyond the “plays” subcategory. With the border parent category more data would lead to a more accurate result with the higher amounts.
