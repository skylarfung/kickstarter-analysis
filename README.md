# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends within sucessful and failed campaigns

## General Analysis of Data
The analysis of the Kickstarter data found that the mean goal of successful campaigns was $5,048 while the median was $3,000. The mean goal for failed campaigns was $10,554 and the median was $5,000. The standard deviation for successful campaigns was $7,748 and for failed was $21,967. With such a large standard deviation, the data is spread out greatly and not clustered around the mean. The data also has a few outliers that effect the standard deviation and skew the data. To perform further analysis it would be wise to remove the outliers and redo the analysis to get a better conclusion.
